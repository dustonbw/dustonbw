Hi, I'm Duston.

I'm a computer & technology enthusiast and computer programming student.
I have a background in theatre production and project management, and I'm interested in the guts of the computer, the arts & technology, and the art of technology.

Find me at <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.coffee/@headclouded">@headclouded@mastodon.coffee</a> on the fediverse,
or on my <a href="https://dustonbw.com">homepage</a>.
