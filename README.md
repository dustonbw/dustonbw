- 👋 Hi, I’m @dustonbw
- 👀 I’m interested in: a lot of things, especially the crossover between arts and technology & different design areas!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: some basic coding - mostly processing-java and basic frontend web development
     - eventually I want to learn simple scripting & command-line programs, and move more towards open-source
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure yet!
- 📫 How to reach me: @headclouded@mastodon.online or @headclouded on twitter
